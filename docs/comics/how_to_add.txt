ADDING COMICS

FOLDER STRUCTURE
docs/comics/
  index.html
  viewer.html
  comics.json
  assets/
    <comic-id>/
      001.jpg
      002.jpg
      ...

STEP 1 — PREPARE PAGES
• Export each page as an image
• Use JPG or WebP
• Keep images web-safe (~2000–3000px long edge)

Pages MUST be named with leading zeros:
  001.jpg
  002.jpg
  003.jpg

Single-page comics still use:
  001.jpg

STEP 2 — CREATE COMIC FOLDER
Inside docs/comics/assets/, create:
  <comic-id>/

Rules for comic-id:
• lowercase
• hyphens only
• no spaces

Example:
  docs/comics/assets/comic-id-goes-here/

Upload page images there.

STEP 3 — REGISTER IN comics.json
Open docs/comics/comics.json and add an entry:

{
  "id": "comic-id-goes-here",
  "title": "Title Goes Here",
  "description": "Description goes here",
  "ext": "jpg",
  "pages": 12,
  "completed": "YYYY-MM-DD"
}

FIELD NOTES
• id          → must match folder name exactly
• title       → displayed on site
• description → optional
• ext         → file extension without dot
• pages       → total number of pages
• completed   → YYYY-MM-DD (shown as natural date)

STEP 4 — COMMIT
After committing:
• Comic appears on /comics/
• Page 001 is used as the cover thumbnail
• Viewer opens at page 1
• Navigation works automatically
